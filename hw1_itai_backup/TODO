1. BlockUntil isn't working as intended. For example:
    Because it's waiting for "OT", it will be a problem if we receive UOFF, FROM, etc. 
    I think we should change this function. Change to the following:
        Add boolean (or, int with val 0 or 1?) to chat struct "occupied"
        If we send a message to chat's member, set this occupied to true. 
        If we then find that chat's readfd is set, we just skip over it every time until we receive an OT. 
    This will allow for us to be able to receive other messages through the server instead of having to handle them from within the blockuntil function.
    If you look at /*SERVER PART*/, I have implemented UOFF and FROM to work there. So if we change the blockuntil function to what I said, it will work
    properly.

2. Implement MROF in server. (if receive MROF, send OT to client.)
    I currently send OT in the TO part, just because I want to test OT getting received. But it should not be there, it should only be sent when we get a MROF.

3. Lots and lots of error checking. And things we need to implement that I can't remember.s
